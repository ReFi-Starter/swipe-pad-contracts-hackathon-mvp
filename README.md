> 🚨 **SMART CONTRACT SECURITY DISCLAIMER**
>
> These smart contracts are part of a **hackathon project** and are **NOT PRODUCTION READY**. Important considerations:
>
> - **NO AUDIT**: These contracts have not undergone a professional security audit
> - **EXPERIMENTAL**: The code is experimental and may contain bugs or vulnerabilities
> - **HIGH RISK**: Do not use these contracts with substantial amounts of funds
> - **IN DEVELOPMENT**: The contract architecture may change significantly
> - **TEST ONLY**: Only use on testnet for demonstration purposes
>
> While we follow smart contract security best practices and our code is based on the battle-tested [Pool-Escrow](https://github.com/Pool-Escrow/Pool-Contracts) architecture,
> this implementation is still experimental and meant for hackathon demonstration purposes only.

## Overview

The SwipePad smart contracts power our decentralized donation platform on Celo, enabling secure and transparent micro-donations through MiniPay. Our core contract, `DonationPool`, manages the entire lifecycle of donation campaigns with two flexible funding models.

## Project Origins

SwipePad's smart contract architecture is built upon the foundation of [Pool-Escrow](https://github.com/Pool-Escrow/Pool-Contracts), another successful project from our team that powers [PoolParty.cc](https://poolparty.cc). We've forked and adapted the core Pool contract architecture to create a specialized version for handling charitable donations with the following enhancements:

### Key Differences from Pool-Escrow

- Specialized for charitable donations and impact campaigns
- Integration with MiniPay for mobile-first UX
- Additional funding models (All-or-Nothing & Keep-What-You-Raise)
- Enhanced dispute resolution for charitable contexts
- Multi-currency support focused on Celo stablecoins
- Optimized fee structure for micro-donations

### Key Features

- Campaign creation and management
- Multi-currency donation support (cUSD, cEUR, cKES)
- Flexible funding models (All-or-Nothing & Keep-What-You-Raise)
- Role-based access control
- Emergency pause functionality
- Dispute resolution system
- Comprehensive event logging

## Smart Contract Architecture
